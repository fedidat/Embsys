This is the repo for the course in Embedded Systems @ JCT 2013. 

This course teaches practices in low-level development, for instance memory mapping, controllers, compilers/linkers, drivers, among many other things. The development is mainly driven around the ARC processor, for which an Ubuntu VM provides the necessary tools. The course has lectures every week as well as homework which make up 100% of the grade for the course.
