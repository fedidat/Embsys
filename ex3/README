Notes:

BONUS 1: rewrite the SMS protocol source, 10 pts, DONE. (with some help...)
BONUS 2: slave mode, 15 pts, DONE.

Our device ID is 07665692

There are 5 threads:
Display thread          - renders the display
Input panel thread		- reacts to the pad button presses
Receive network thread 	- receives incoming packets
Send network thread 	- sends SMS relevant data accross the network
UART send thread		- sends characters to the device's master using UART

Slave mode:
- As Uri said, timestamp time without date is good.
- Also, no need for outgoing message timestamp (not present in SMS_DELIVER), zeros are sent instead.
- Everything is in half bytes. For example, sending an SMS to address "01010101"
  with the text "aaaa" is done this way: "SM 08 0002000200020002 04 61616161." (without quotes/spaces)
  In the same way, an incoming SMS of index 1 at 05:41:36 from "0" to "02020202" with the message "test" 
  will be: "MC 01 054136 08 0002000200020002 01 00 04 74657374."
